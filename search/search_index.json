A GIS user uses GIS tools created by a GIS developer to interact with GIS data. Over time, as the importance of location information has increased in areas outside the traditional GIS industry, the term \"GIS\" has evolved to refer to anything related to geospatial data . As for that: Geospatial , or just Spatial , data is simply data with location information included. But what does that mean , exactly? Spatial isn't so special Let's take a look at \"regular\" data, versus \"spatial\" data, using a public dataset from data.austintexas.gov . Below is a table of data. Each row represents a single record, and each column has a name describing its content. If you've ever edited data in a spreadsheet, this probably seems familiar. Here, we have a table of firestations in Austin, TX: To turn that table of data into geospatial data, all we need to do is add location information to each record. Here, we've added longitude and latitude (or lon/lat ) coordinates to that same table of firestations. Pairs of lon/lat values are used to represent a point on the Earth's surface: Using that location information, we can then create a map of our original data. Each point on this map represents one firestation from the table mapped in the city of Austin, TX: Putting it all together Geospatial data doesn't actually become \"a map\" until it's combined with other data in layers . In the map above, there are actually many layers of data, including: Water boundaries showing lakes, rivers, and ponds Road data showing the streets & highways Topographic data used to show the terrain (hills and valleys) ...and of course, the firestation location data! Being able to combine multiple sources of data into an integrated whole allows us to start asking questions and using our data to solve problems. Spatial Problem Solving GIS, geospatial data, and maps help us humans connect a what to a where . When we're able to connect what we know with where we are then we can use those connections to solve problems and make decisions. One good approach to asking questions with data is the following five-step Spatial Problem Solving process: Ask & explore: \"Does our city have sufficient firestations to respond to emergencies across the city in a timely manner?\" Model & compute: Get a list of existing firestations in the city and compute their coordinate locations Examine & interpret: Combine data layers to show firestations on a map of the city. Include other GIS data sets that can help you make decisions, like roads, building locations, traffic density and more. Make decisions: \"It looks like this new neighborhood is five miles from the nearest firestation, and the road sees a lot of traffic which can slow response time even more. The answer to my question is 'no': we don't have enough firestations to keep our city safe.\" Share results: Take your findings to city planning: the city needs to build a new firestation! Next week, we'll learn about a specialized kind of spatial problem solving that uses GIS called Remote Sensing , and how we can use satellites in orbit to study the earth up close. Activity This week we're going to use an interactive GIS web app, Urban Observatory , to explore geospatial data for cities around the world. Thinking Critically with GIS Working at your own pace, learn the basics of Urban Observatory using the guide at https://learn.arcgis.com/en/projects/from-london-to-tokyo/ . When you reach the end of Step 15 , come back to the group. In your groups, take some time to come up with a few questions that you think you might be able to answer using the Urban Observatory's data. Then as a group discuss the spatial questions you came up with: what kind of data would you need to explore in order to answer these questions? What data would you look for to help make a decision and answer your questions? Send your questions and any discussion notes to summercamp@planet.com if you'd like to share your work with us.

Kelsey is a Space Systems Engineer in Satellite Operations at Planet, operating the Dove and SuperDove satellite constellation. She is passionate about using space technology to help life on Earth and is pursuing her PhD at Oxford University to research how to use Earth Observation datasets to tackle climate change.

She spends her time outside of work training for a triathlon, painting landscapes in acrylics, and volunteering at the Monterey Bay Aquarium to teach and inspire ocean conservation. Sarah is a Product Marketing Manager at Planet, working across the sales and product teams to bring tangible remote sensing solutions to data-hungry markets. In addition to storytelling, she is an avid reader and puzzler, drinking way too much tea and wrangling her labradoodle puppy.","title":"Week 1: Hello, World"},{"location":"week1/#week-1-hello-world","text":"","title":"Week 1: Hello, World"},{"location":"week1/#gis-geospatial-data","text":"You might have heard of the acronym GIS : GIS stands for G eographic I nformation S ystems, and can refer to computer systems, infrastructure, software, data, or any mix of these things together.

Each Dove is about the size of a small dog, or a little bigger than a loaf of bread: More than a hundred Doves orbit the Earth every day. Their job is to take pictures of everywhere on Earth, and then send those pictures back home to us here on the surface of the planet. The scientists that work with those kinds of pictures call this Remote Sensing . But what is Remote Sensing good for? Why are scientists so interested in these pictures? Getting a Bird\u2019s Eye View When we are able to view our own planet from a distance, we can see all sorts of things that we might not necessarily be able to see down here from the surface. Think about zooming out with your camera: remote sensing is how we zoom out to see more of our planet. Ever since cameras were invented, humans have been looking for ways to take pictures above the surface of Earth. In fact, in the early 1900s, some people even trained pigeons to carry automatic cameras so that they could take pictures while flying! An early remote sensing system: a camera worn by a pigeon to take pictures of the Earth from above Today most remote sensing images don\u2019t come from birds: instead, now we can use airplanes and satellites to carry the cameras. Of course, that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t also name some of our satellites after birds! A pair of Doves flying into orbit high above the Earth What Changes and What Stays the Same Getting a good look at our planet from above lets us see change over time: if we repeatedly collect remote sensing data, we can see things like: A farmer\u2019s field that goes from lush and green in summer to brown and dry in winter A living coral reef in the Pacific Ocean as it changes size and shape A forest that gradually shrinks as its trees are cut down A city\u2019s streets before and after a hurricane sends rain to flood the roads And much more. Being able to observe change like that allows us humans to learn things that we might not otherwise have known without the remote sensing data. Seeing change lets us understand the effects of things like climate change and human activity on our planet. Activity This week\u2019s activity is about art: you can either create a digital masterpiece on your computer, or print the template linked below. If you print the template you'll also want to bring colored pencils, pens, or markers to your desk on Tuesday. Every single Dove in orbit right now is decorated with its own unique art. Together, the Doves make up the world\u2019s first art exhibit in space. You can read more about Planet's Art In Space here . If you could design any art to go to space, what would it be?
